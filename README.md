## Crafting 3D maps of Antarctica with PyGMT and the IBCSO V2 database

This is a (very dynamic) repository for the notebook/tutorial I created to share beautiful 3D maps, mainly of the Antarctic Peninsula, made with PyGMT using the new International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) V2.

There are a few examples in the jupyter notebook and a ready-to-use powerpoint with few editions for anyone who needs.
