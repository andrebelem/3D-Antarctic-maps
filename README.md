History: July, 2024 - update for new colab version and new PyGMT. **Note** that we recommend you install pygmt in a conda enviroment. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html).
If you want to use the local version, get the IBCSO V2 data (see postBuild file).

This is a (very dynamic) repository for the notebook/tutorial I created to share beautiful 3D maps, mainly of the Antarctic Peninsula, made with PyGMT using the new International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) V2 ([Dorschel et al, 2022](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.937574)).

There are a few examples in the jupyter notebook (you can try using Binder - see below) and a ready-to-use [**Powerpoint** file](https://github.com/andrebelem/3D-Antarctic-maps/blob/main/3D_Antarctic_Maps.pptx) with few editions for anyone who needs.
