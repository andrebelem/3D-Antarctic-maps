This is a (very dynamic) repository for the notebook/tutorial I created to share beautiful 3D maps, mainly of the Antarctic Peninsula, made with PyGMT using the new International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) V2.

There are a few examples in the jupyter notebook and a ready-to-use [powerpoint](https://github.com/andrebelem/3D-Antarctic-maps/blob/main/3D_Antarctic_Maps.pptx) with few editions for anyone who needs.

Enjoy !
